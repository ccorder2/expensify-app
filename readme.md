# Expensify

Get your expenses in order with this application. When first visiting you are prompted to login via the Google provider. Once signed in the user is displayed a view of their current expenses with three filters above the list: text search, sort order, and a date range. To see all expenses, clear the filters. The user also has the ability to add, edit and delete expenses. The technologies used to develop this solution are Firebase, React, Redux, and Webpack. You can visit the application [here](http://apps.expensify.caseycorder.com).
